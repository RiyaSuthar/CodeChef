Alice wants to send a message to Bob over an insecure channel. Eve is eavesdropper. Hence, Alice encrypts her message in the following way:
Assumptions 
Plaintext represents the original message. 
Ciphertext represents the encrypted message. 
The keys are used to encrypt the plaintext. 
Consider {A=0,B=1,?,Z=25}. 
There are no spaces, newlines or other punctuation symbols in plain text 

Key Generation : Alice chooses two keys K1,K2<26 and securely sends K1,K2 to Bob. 

Encryption : 
Encryption function is C=(P×K2)+K1 mod 26; where P is the plaintext and C is the ciphertext. 

Decryption : 
Decryption function is P=(C-K1)×K-12 mod 26; where P is the plaintext and C is the ciphertext; K-12 is the multiplicative inverse in GF(26) i.e. 1=K-12×K2 mod 26. 

Example: 
Plaintext : HELLOWORLD = {7 4 11 11 14 22 14 17 11 3} 
Keys : K1=3,K2=7. 
K-12=15 as 7×15=1 mod 26. 
Cipher Text: AFCCXBXSCY = {0 5 2 2 23 1 23 18 2 24} 

Assume Eve has captured a few ciphertexts. You need to write the decryption program such that with the given keys and the ciphertext it recovers the plaintext
